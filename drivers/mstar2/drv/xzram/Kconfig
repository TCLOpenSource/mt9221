          Only workable at 2.6.36 or later version
	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/xzramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings. You can use internal memory from
          Kernel or external from a specific physical address.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

          This module is base on zram block device driver.
